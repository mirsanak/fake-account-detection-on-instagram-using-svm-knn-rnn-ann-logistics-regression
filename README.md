Fake Account Detection on Instagram
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) :
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. In the context of fake account detection on Instagram, KNN can play a significant role in identifying whether an account is fake or real based on its features.



Description:

This project implements a machine learning model to detect fake social media accounts on Instagram. Using user features and engagement metrics, the model predicts whether an account is genuine or fake.

Installation:

Prerequisites

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Setup

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-account-detection.git
cd fake-account-detection

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

Run knn.ipynb to train and test the model.

Usage:

Open knn.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Run all cells to load the dataset, train the model, and evaluate performance.

Check accuracy and classification metrics for results.

Dataset:

The dataset contains Instagram account features such as:

Number of followers

Number of following

Post count

Engagement rate

Source: Custom dataset (or specify if using a public dataset)

Model & Approach

Machine Learning Model: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Feature Selection: Extracts relevant user attributes from Instagram accounts.

Goal: Classify accounts as fake or real based on feature patterns.
